# NewPortfolio

When completed, this will be the professional portfolio I will showcase & send people to when referencing my work

To be Done:
-make the pills to be a different color when hovering over them
-make the contact modal
-either get rid of bulma css or find a way to make it work
-get background colors of separate sections down
-organize the frontend & backend skills into multiple rows of the images instead of two columns; less vertical movement & better use of space
